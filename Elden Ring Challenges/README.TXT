A basic challenge run generator script.
Script asks for whether you want an SL1 run, uncapped, or random
Script asks for whether you want a base class type: melee, ranged, castor, or any
Script asks for whether you want to region lock, yes, no, or any
Script asks for whether you want to use SotE content with, without, or randomly using scadu fragments or skipping sote content entirely.

It then generates from each of these functions and provides a customized challenge run the player can use on their next Elden Ring play.
